# MACHINE LEARNING MODEL IMPLEMENTATION

**TASK 4 - MACHINE LEARNING MODEL IMPLEMENTATION**

**COMPANY**: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

**NAME**: Harshal Devidas Thorat

**INTERN ID**: CT6WJEG

**DOMAIN**: Python Programming

**BATCH DURATION**: January 5th, 2025 to February 20th, 2025

**MENTOR NAME**: NEELA SANTHOSH

DESCRIPTION OF TASK

This project showcases a predictive model built using Scikit-learn to classify data. The primary focus is on developing a machine learning model to solve a classification problem (e.g., spam email detection). The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization, all documented in a Jupyter Notebook.

Key Features:

Dataset Handling: Loading and preprocessing data for machine learning.
Model Selection: Training a classification model using Random Forest.
Evaluation: Analyzing model performance with accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.
Visualization: Displaying results with heatmaps for better insights.
Deliverable: A Jupyter Notebook containing step-by-step implementation and evaluation of the model.
